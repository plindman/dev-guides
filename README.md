# dev-guides

This is my personal, modular collection of development guides and best practices.

It includes setup instructions, workflows, coding standards, and tooling choices across different languages and environments. The goal is to keep things reusable, scalable, and easy to apply across projects.

## Structure

- `python/` – Python development standards, tooling, testing, and configuration
- `git/` – Git workflow, commit practices, and merge strategies
- `templates/` – Reusable configs like `.gitignore` or pre-commit setup
- `js/` – JavaScript-related guides (to be expanded)

## Usage

You can clone or reference this repo from any project. For example:
- Link to guides in README files
- Copy or customize config templates
- Keep your practices consistent across projects
